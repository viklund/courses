## Questions:  

**Q4.1:** What was the highest coverage for any of your contigs?  

**Q4.2:** Do you think that the completeness of your SC genome will improve with more sequence data? Why? Will your genome ever be ‘complete’?  

**Q4.3:** How would you explain the coverage patterns you can see on the contigs called NODE_7 and NODE_4.  

**Q4.4:** How many chimeric reads did you find in your original dataset? Do you think this value is a true representation of the total amount of chimeras?  

**Q4.5:** What was the average insert size in this dataset?
